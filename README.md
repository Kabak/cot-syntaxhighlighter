## Color themes

Plugin bundled with a pack of [predefined color themes](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/themes/).
But you can adjust some of it to suit you needs with Cotonti theme colors. To do that copy theme CSS file from
`syntaxhighlighter/lib/styles` folder to your theme sub folder named `styles` â€” `themes/themename/styles`.
Now you can change it for your needs or create your own. All CSS files located in `themes/themename/styles` folder
override default ones with same names.
